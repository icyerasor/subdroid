# subdroid
A really old, outdated and low quality (code) implemenation of an android app that can browse and download (not check out!) SVN repositories. (http(s):// only, not svn://)

Developed back in 2009, with eclipse, starting from the "Notes" Android Dev Example App.

Dependency on [svn lib](https://github.com/icyerasor/svnl)
